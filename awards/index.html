			<h3>Scholarship for Students</h3>
 
			<p>SBP-BRiMS 2017 has obtained grant funding that will provide a number of registration and travel scholarships for students, to help them attend the conference. 
			   These awards will cover early registration costs for local students. This can include tutorial fees. For non-local students, the award will cover 
			   early registration, tutorial fees, some travel, and lodging expenses. The total amount in this case is $800. The goal of the student scholarship 
			   is to help promote increased attendance by college students. The successful applicant can apply the scholarship to pay for conference fee, tutorials, 
			   and/or travel. Preference is given to those students who are presenting papers or posters, or taking part in the challenge problem. To help further 
			   reduce attendance costs, participating students may wish to share rooms with other attendees.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Amount</strong>:  Determined based on need. Scholarships are based on actual expenses and are not a fixed amount. The maximum that can be 
			received per person is $800.
			</p>
			
			<p>When applying  for a student scholarship you will need to use the conference registration system.  In that system:</p>
			<ol class="alpha">

				<li>Submit a statement, no more than 800 words explaining why they wish to attend the conference; confirm what university you are at; the name 
					of the program; and your advisor's name and contact information; and explain why you need the financial support.</li>

			   applicant is at that university, that they are a student in good standing, and that there is a need for financial support.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Diversity Scholarships</h3>
 
			<p>SBP-BRiMS 2017 has obtained grant funding that will provide a number of registration and travel scholarships to promote diversity. Support 
			   will be available to participants from underrepresented groups (racial minority, females, or participants from the social sciences, economic 
			   or managerial sciences, or biomedical research fields) to help them attend the conference and contribute to the disciplinary diversity. 
			   These awards will cover early registration costs for local conference participants. This can include tutorial fees.  For non-local students, 
			   the award will cover early registration, tutorial fees, and some travel, and lodging expenses. The total amount in this case is $800. These 
			   awards are available to students, post-docs, and non-students who belong to one or more of the underrepresented groups indicated. The goal 
			   of the diversity scholarship is to help promote involvement by diverse groups. Preference is given to applicants who are presenting papers 
			   or posters, or taking part in the challenge problem.</p>
