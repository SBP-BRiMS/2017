                	SBP-BRiMS17 will feature a Best Paper Award, a Best Student Paper Award and a set of scholarships for students. All papers are qualified for the Best 
                	Paper Award. Papers with student first authors will be considered for the Best Student Paper Award.
			</p>
			<p>
			SBP-BRiMS 2017 has two types of scholarships available:  a diversity scholarship and a student scholarship.  You can apply for either or both awards.  However, you can only receive one award.
			Scholarships are based on actually expenses and so are not a fixed amount.  The maximum that can be received per person is $800 USD.
			</p>
			<p>Applicant must first <a href="http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/sbpbrims/account.php" target="_blank">create an account here</a> to apply for the scholarships. After setting up for an account for the conference, you can then apply for one or both awards. All applicants should also register for the conference, just simply not pay for registration until after the awards have been issued.</p>
 
			<h3>Scholarship for Students</h3>
 
			<p>We have obtained grant funding that will provide a number of registration and travel scholarships for students, to help them attend the conference. These awards will cover registration costs for local students. For non-local students, the award will cover up to $800 for registration, travel, and lodging expenses. The goal of the student scholarship is to help promote increased attendance by college students. The successful applicant can apply the scholarship to pay for conference fee, tutorials, and/or travel. Preference is given to those students who are presenting papers or posters, or taking part in the challenge problem.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Amount</strong>:  Determined based on need. Scholarships are based on actual expenses and are not a fixed amount. The maximum that can be received per person is $800.
			</p>
			<p>When applying  for a student scholarship you will need to:</p>
			<ol class="alpha">
				<li>Fill out all contact information</li>
				<li>Submit a statement, no more than 800 words explaining why they wish to attend the conference; confirm what university they are at; the name of the program; and their advisors name and contact information; explain why you need the financial support.</li>
				<li>Have your advisor send an email to <a href="mailto:sbpbrims@andrew.cmu.edu">sbpbrims@andrew.cmu.edu</a> confirming that the applicant is at that university, that they are a student in good standing, and that there is a need for financial support.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Diversity Scholarship</h3>
 
			<p>We also have funding that will provide a limited travel support (registration, travel, hotel) for the purpose of increasing diversity at SBP-BRIMS 2017. Support will be available to participants from underrepresented groups (racial minority, females, or participants from the social sciences, economic or managerial sciences, or biomedical research fields) to help them attend the conference and contribute to the disciplinary diversity. These awards will cover registration costs for local conference participants. For non-local participants, the award will cover up to $800 for registration, travel, and lodging expenses. These awards are available to students, post-docs, and non-students who belong to one or more of the underrepresented groups indicated. The goal of the diversity scholarship is to help promote involvement by diverse groups.  The successful applicant can apply the scholarship to pay for conference fee, tutorials, and/or travel.  Preference is given to those students who are presenting papers or posters, or taking part in the challenge problem.</p>
