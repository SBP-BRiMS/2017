                        <h3>PRE-CONFERENCE  TUTORIAL SESSIONS:</h3>
                        Several half-day sessions will be offered on the day before the full conference. Sessions will be designed to meet the needs of one of two distinct groups. One group will consist of attendees who have backgrounds in computational science; computer science, engineering, and other mathematically oriented disciplines. Other tutorial sessions will be designed for behavioral and social scientists and others  (e.g. those with medical backgrounds or training in public health) who may have limited  formal education in the computational sciences. Attendees will gain an understanding of terminology, theories, and general approaches employed by computationally based fields, especially with respect to modeling approaches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Tutorial proposal submission:</h3>
                        Tutorial proposals should be submitted in plain text or PDF, by email to the tutorial chair, <a href="mailto:yurulin@pitt.edu">Yu-Ru Lin</a>. The email should have "SBP-BRiMS 2017 tutorial submission" in the subject header. The proposal should include the following elements: </br>
                        * Title of the tutorial </br>
                        * Description of the tutorial topic and expected audience (including the expected backgrounds of the attendees) </br>
                        * Short bio and contact information of the organizers </br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More details regarding the preconference tutorial sessions, including instructors, course content, and registration information will be posted to the conference website (<a href="/cft">SBP-BRiMS.org</a>) as soon as this information becomes available. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that the plans for the tutorial sessions are in progress and are subject to change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>POSTER & NETWORKING SESSION:</h3>
                        We expect to invite the majority of all authors of paper submissions to present a poster at a catered poster and network session.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>DEMO SESSION:</h3>
                        We invite technical demonstrations from academia, industry and government.  Please submit a 2-page abstract.  We will provide a desk and power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<h3>CHALLENGE:</h3>
                    	The conference expects to announce a data modeling challenge as in previous years.

                    <p>
                        <h3>FUNDING PANEL & CROSS-FERTILIZATION ROUNDTABLES:</h3>
                        Previous SBP conferences have included a Cross-fertilization Roundtable session or a Funding Panel. The purpose of the cross-fertilization roundtables is to help participants become better acquainted with people outside of their discipline and with whom they might consider partnering on future SBP-related research collaborations. The Funding Panel provides an opportunity for conference participants to interact with program managers from various federal funding agencies. Participants for the previous funding panels have included representatives from federal agencies, such as the NSF,
NIH, DoD, ONR, AFOSR, USDA, etc.  The details for 2017 will be confirmed at a later date.
