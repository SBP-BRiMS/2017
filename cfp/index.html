                        <h3>PRE-CONFERENCE  TUTORIAL SESSIONS:</h3>
                        Several half-day sessions will be offered on the day before the full conference. Sessions will be designed to meet the needs of one of two 
                        distinct groups. One group will consist of attendees who have backgrounds in computational science; computer science, engineering, and other 
                        mathematically oriented disciplines. Other tutorial sessions will be designed for behavioral and social scientists and others  (e.g. those with 
                        medical backgrounds or training in public health) who may have limited  formal education in the computational sciences. Attendees will gain an 
                        understanding of terminology, theories, and general approaches employed by computationally based fields, especially with respect to modeling approaches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Tutorial proposal submission:</h3>
                        Tutorial proposals should be submitted online to <a href="mailto:sbpbrims@andrew.cmu.edu">sbpbrims@andrew.cmu.edu:</a>. At minimum, each proposal must
                        contain the following information: </br>
                        * Title of the tutorial </br>
                        * Description of the tutorial topic and structure.
                        * Expected audience (including the expected backgrounds of the attendees) </br>
                        * Short bio and contact information of the organizers </br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More details regarding the preconference tutorial sessions, including instructors, course content, and registration information will be posted to 
                        the conference website (<a href="/cft">SBP-BRiMS.org</a>) as soon as this information becomes available. For further information, please contact
                        <a href="mailto:sbpbrims@andrew.cmu.edu">sbpbrims@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.

                    	<h3>CHALLENGE:</h3>
                    	The conference expects to announce a computational challenge as in previous years.  Additional details will be posted on the conference
                    	website.

                    <p>
                        <h3>FUNDING PANEL & CROSS-FERTILIZATION ROUNDTABLES:</h3>
                        Previous SBP conferences have included a Cross-fertilization Roundtable session or a Funding Panel. The purpose of the cross-fertilization 
                        roundtables is to help participants become better acquainted with people outside of their discipline and with whom they might consider 
                        partnering on future SBP-related research collaborations. The Funding Panel provides an opportunity for conference participants to interact 
                        with program managers from various federal funding agencies. Participants for the previous funding panels have included representatives from 
                        federal agencies, such as the NSF, NIH, DoD, ONR, AFOSR, USDA, etc.
