			<div class="title"><h3>Overview</h3></div>
                    <p>
                    	Social networking websites let users post and share opinions on the web ‘freely’. The authors of the posts 
                    	are not required to verify the authenticity of the content created. This has lead to the issue of spreading 
                    	misinformation. False or misleading information that has not been verified and could not be substantiated by 
                    	facts are sometimes virally circulated on social media giving an impression of authenticity, and sometimes 
                    	leads to undesirable consequences. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In this year’s SBP-BRiMS challenge problem, we ask participants to consider the issue of circulation of fake 
						news and propaganda on online media for personal or political gains. Using at least one of the suggested 
						datasets (discussed later), and any other relevant publicly accessible dataset, this year’s challenge problem 
						asks participants to address any issue of interest to you (or your team). The issue should relate to any of 
						the following topics:   Fake News and/or Propaganda. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The broad questions of interest are:
						<ul>
							<li>How can we use openly available data to find fake news?</li>
							<li>How is propaganda used on online social media and news outlets?</li>
							<li>How are bots used to propagate fake news or propaganda?</li>
							<li>What interventions might slow the spread of fake news or propaganda?</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						These questions are only intended to give a rough idea of what might be an interesting topic to explore for 
						this challenge problem, and by no means the only questions of interest. All entries must have both a strong 
						social theory, political theory or policy perspective and a strong methodology perspective.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="title"><h3>Rules</h3></div>

					<div class="title"><h3>Guidelines</h3></div>
                    <p>A strong entry will have one or more of these components:</p>
                    <p>
                    	<ul>
                    		<li>Employ multiple data sets.</li>
                    		<li>Include a high quality visualization (note that participants will be allowed to display dynamic
                    			visualizations via some form of electronic mediae.g., by hanging a tablet from the poster. However, 
                    			<strong>please note that tables will not be provided.</strong></li>
                    		<li>Account for biases in the data across time, space, topics and sources.</li>
                    		<li>Provide a new metric or algorithm development such as:</li>
                    			<ol>
                    				<li>A new spatial, temporal, and network analytic methodologies and algorithms that can
                    					cope with the vast scale of open source data (e.g. Twitter data) and support answering a key social or policy issue.</li>
                    				<li>A new spatial analytic methodology that can better take into account change over
                    					time and non-spatial distances (such as co-occurrences and semantic similarity between 
                    					locations).</li>
                    				<li>A new network methodology that better incorporate the diversity of actor and
                    					relationship types in the data, spatio-temporal information, or for constructing edges 
                    					from the data and for distributing actor and edge attributes onto the graph.</li>
                    				<li>A novel simulation that that supports reasoning about the spread of fake news or propaganda that uses 
                    					empirical data to either instantiate the model or to confirm some of the results.</li>
								</ol>
                    		<li>Generate a new empirical finding that challenges or provides novel support for existing social or political theory, 
                    			or provides information of policy relevance.  Note, the results of computer simulation are viewed as empirical findings.</li>
						</ul>		
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>In addition, a strong entry should be well-written and provide some level of creativity in its use of or combination of data.</p>

					<div class="title"><h3>Data Sets</h3></div>
						<p>We invite participants to explore one or more of these data sets: Kaggle Fake News, Kaggle Propaganda, 
						ClickBait, Wikipedia or GDELT in conjunction with a second data set which may or may not be from this list. 
						The datasets below consists of records of individual politically-relevant events, from statements of support 
						to military attacks. Each record includes information on the source and target of each action, its date and 
						location, and information about the event itself, machine-coded from media reports.  It is important to note 
						that the sites listed as “fake” are those that appear fake to the coding algorithm or human coder, and may or 
						may not actually be fake news sites.</p>

						<p><em><strong>Kaggle Fake News:</strong></em></p>
						<p>Source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news">https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news</a></p>
						<p>Kaggle has a dataset on fake news. The dataset was added by Megan Risdal and shares data collected by 
							‘BS Detector’ chrome extension that was created by Daniel Sieradski. The data contains text and metadata 
							information from 244 different websites and contains 12,999 posts.</p>
						<p>Please check the website <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news">https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news</a>.</p>

						<p><em><strong>Kaggle Propoganda:</strong></em></p>
						<p>Source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kzaman/how-isis-uses-twitter">https://www.kaggle.com/kzaman/how-isis-uses-twitter</a></p>
						<p>Kaggle also has a dataset on how ISIS uses Twitter. The dataset contains over 17,000 pro ISIS tweets since Nov 2015 Paris attack.</p>

						<p><em><strong>GDELT:</strong></em></p>
						<p>The GDELT database (<a href="http://www.gdeltproject.org/">http://www.gdeltproject.org/</a>) is divided into three core data 
							streams, capturing physical activity, counts of key incidents like death, and a graph structure capturing the latent and 
							physical aspects of the global news into a single computable network. GDELT’s event data consists of a quarter-billion 
							geo-referenced dyadic “event records” covering all countries in the world 1979 to present, capturing who did what to whom, 
							when, and where in the CAMEO taxonomy.
						</p>
						<p>
							GDELT’s count data (2013-present) records mentions of counts of things with respect to a set of predefined categories such 
							as a number of protesters, a number killed, or a number displaced or sickened. GDELT’s Global Knowledge Graph (2013-present) 
							is an attempt to connect the people, organizations, locations, counts, themes, news sources, and events appearing in the 
							news media across the globe each day into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what 
							its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, each day.
						</p>

						<p>
							The following website contains a set of links to various GDELT APIs and datasets.  New APIS are forthcoming of particular 
							relevance to this challenge. <a href="http://blog.gdeltproject.org/datasets-sbp-brims-2017-grand-interdisciplinary-data-science-challenge-fake-news/"
