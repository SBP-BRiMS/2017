                    <p>Dr. Martina Morris a sociologist with interests in the analysis of social structure and population 
                    	dynamics. She received her Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Chicago in 1989. She holds a 
                    	joint appointment as professor in the departments of Sociology and Statistics at the University of 
                    	Washington, and is the founding director of the Sociobehavioral and Prevention Research Core in the 
                    	UW CFAR (Center for Aids Research). Her work focuses on the development of statistical methodology 
                    	for network analysis, applications to modeling epidemics on networks, and developing local models 
                    	for HIV prevention planning.
                    </p>
                    <p>Her research is interdisciplinary, intersecting with demography, economics, epidemiology and public 
                    	health, and statistics. Examples from her current projects include the study of partnership networks 
                    	in the spread of HIV/AIDS, the impact of economic restructuring on inequality and mobility, and the 
                    	development of Relative Distribution methods for statistical analysis. She joined the faculty at the 
                    	University of Washington in September 2000. 
                    </p>

                        Talk title: <b>From AI to AI: Acquiring Social Media Intelligence via "Big" Data</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abstract: As the old adage goes, “knowledge is power”. With the pervasive presence of big data, data is a new source 
                        of power. Social media data is mainly user-generated with geo-spatial, pictorial, temporal, and social information. 
                        We use social media data to acquire intelligence about user behavior, user needs, sentiment, opinions, and trends. 
                        This presentation examines issues arising from social media intelligence acquisition: why data is power, whether big 
                        data is really big, how we can solve problems or verify hypotheses with social media data, how we can obtain interpretable 
                        machine-extracted topics, and how we can figure out what we don’t know. With adaptive and evolving bots, social media
                        intelligence could be obfuscated with rampant misinformation, thus it is challenging to acquire accurate social media 
                        intelligence. With the joint force of AI and social media data, we hope to develop novel algorithms for acquiring social 
                        media intelligence with collaborative research.

                    <p>
                        Abstract: The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC)
                        serves as the principal analytical organization for TRADOC. TRACâ€™s analyses informing
                        major Army acquisition decisions often rely on models and simulations (M&amp;S) to
                        represent the operational environment and assess the impacts of materiel alternatives.
                        TRAC-developed M&amp;S are the standard within the Department of Defense for modeling
                        the operational environment to support analyses at the tactical and operational levels.
                        This presentation will highlight the use of three TRAC models â€“ Advanced Warfighting
                        Simulation, Combined Arms Analysis Tool for the 21st Century, and Logistics Battle
                        Command â€“ to support TRAC studies that underpinned major Army acquisition decisions.
