                    <p>Dr. Martina Morris a sociologist with interests in the analysis of social structure and population 
                    	dynamics. She received her Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Chicago in 1989. She holds a 
                    	joint appointment as professor in the departments of Sociology and Statistics at the University of 
                    	Washington, and is the founding director of the Sociobehavioral and Prevention Research Core in the 
                    	UW CFAR (Center for Aids Research). Her work focuses on the development of statistical methodology 
                    	for network analysis, applications to modeling epidemics on networks, and developing local models 
                    	for HIV prevention planning.
                    </p>
                    <p>Her research is interdisciplinary, intersecting with demography, economics, epidemiology and public 
                    	health, and statistics. Examples from her current projects include the study of partnership networks 
                    	in the spread of HIV/AIDS, the impact of economic restructuring on inequality and mobility, and the 
                    	development of Relative Distribution methods for statistical analysis. She joined the faculty at the 
                    	University of Washington in September 2000. 
                    </p>
                    <p>At the Center for Aids Research (CFAR), she serves as the Director for the Sociobehavioral and Prevention

                        Talk title: <b>From AI to AI: Acquiring Social Media Intelligence via "Big" Data</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abstract: As the old adage goes, "knowledge is power". With the pervasive presence of big data, data is a new source 
                        of power. Social media data is mainly user-generated with geo-spatial, pictorial, temporal, and social information. 
                        We use social media data to acquire intelligence about user behavior, user needs, sentiment, opinions, and trends. 
                        This presentation examines issues arising from social media intelligence acquisition: why data is power, whether big 
                        data is really big, how we can solve problems or verify hypotheses with social media data, how we can obtain interpretable 
                        machine-extracted topics, and how we can figure out what we don't know. With adaptive and evolving bots, social media
                        intelligence could be obfuscated with rampant misinformation, thus it is challenging to acquire accurate social media 
                        intelligence. With the joint force of AI and social media data, we hope to develop novel algorithms for acquiring social 
                        media intelligence with collaborative research.

                        Abstract: We are witnessing the most rapid and profound change in the global information environment in history.  Furthermore, it 
                        is possibly a seminal moment in the field of military deception.  The speed and reach of internet-driven information operations 
                        are not only unprecedented; the societal implications associated with them are not well understood outside the research community.  
                        In the military, our ability to adapt to this new reality is vitally important as we are in a race to understand this dynamic 
                        information ecosystem and counter capable adversaries who operate without restraint.  
					</p>
					<p>
						How vulnerable are we as a society, and how can we harness the power of social computing as it changes how we live, work, and 
						perceive the world around us?  Moreover, what are the implications of participating in this "arms race" versus simply ceding 
						this critical terrain?  The ability to defend our nation against these powerful information operations extends beyond 
						differentiating between "real" and "fake" news, and the research community will play a vital role in informing both policy 
						and strategy to address these challenges.
