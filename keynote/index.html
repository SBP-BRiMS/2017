                        Talk title: <b>Multi-Formalism Modeling of Complex Strategic Problems</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abstract: The modeling of complex strategic problems often requires development and interoperation of 
                        a set of several models. Each model, developed using different formalisms or modeling 
                        languages, offers unique insights and makes specific assumptions about the problem being 
                        modeled, its participating entities such as human organizations and the means of 
                        communication and processes they use. Interoperation of such models can produce a more 
                        robust modeling and simulation capability to support analysis and evaluation of strategic issues 
                        such as deterrence or the use of cyber exploits. Meta-modeling analysis based on Concept 
                        Maps and Ontologies helps identify what types of interoperation are valid between models 
                        expressed in different formalisms. The approach is illustrated through examples focusing on the 
                        use of several types of models and their use in evaluating functional and non-functional 
                        measures such as resilience.

                        Talk title: <b>So Many Choices, So Few Guidelines: Sifting through Functions on Networks</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abstract: I will present a theoretical approach and an empirical framework for choosing between some popular 
                        functions on networks. (1) Measuring tie-strength: Given a set of people and a set of events attended by them, 
                        how should we measure connectedness or tie strength between each pair of persons? The underlying assumption is 
                        that attendance at mutual events produces an implicit social network between people. I will describe an axiomatic 
                        solution to this problem. (2) Network similarity: Given two networks (without known node-correspondences), how 
                        should we measure similarity between them? This problem occurs frequently in many real-world applications such 
                        as transfer learning, re-identification, and change detection. I will present a guide on how to select a network-similarity method.

                        Talk title: <b>Models and Simulations in support of Army Acquisition</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abstract: The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC)
                        serves as the principal analytical organization for TRADOC. TRAC’s analyses informing
                        major Army acquisition decisions often rely on models and simulations (M&amp;S) to
                        represent the operational environment and assess the impacts of materiel alternatives.
                        TRAC-developed M&amp;S are the standard within the Department of Defense for modeling
                        the operational environment to support analyses at the tactical and operational levels.
                        This presentation will highlight the use of three TRAC models – Advanced Warfighting
                        Simulation, Combined Arms Analysis Tool for the 21st Century, and Logistics Battle
                        Command – to support TRAC studies that underpinned major Army acquisition decisions.
