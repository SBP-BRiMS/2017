                    Currently more than 50% of the world's population lives in cities. This percentage is projected
                    to increase to 70% by 2050 based on a recent report by the United Nations. These levels of
                    urbanization can be partially explained from the long-lived thought of cities as the paramount
                    instrument for innovation and wealth creation. However, the unprecedented levels of urban
                    population has lead the cities to become the main source of crimes, diseases and pollution.
                    Social and urban scientists have been always interested on how people interact within the cities
                    - both with other dwellers and with the city infrastructure as well. However, until recently many of
                    the theories could not be tested at a large scale and/or were based on theoretical assumptions.
                    With the advancements in information technology we are now able to collect data from a large
                    spectrum of urban life facets - ranging from our interaction with the public transportation network
                    to the amount of trash each dweller generates - that can consequently allow us to validate
                    and/or update existing theories, quantify the interactions between dwellers and the environment,
                    as well as inform public policy decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In this tutorial, we will begin by covering urban and social theories developed in the past 50
                    years including the gravity model, psychological maps and the notion of aesthetic capital. We
                    will further presents an application of each theory and ways that we can utilize Web
                    technologies to validate these theories and further exploit them for applications such as
                    navigation algorithms that target happy pedestrian routes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We will then move on to describe data analytics methods that can be used in the context of
                    urban informatics. In particular, we will first discuss quasi-experimental techniques (e.g.,
                    difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity) that can be used to analyze and reach
                    conclusions from observational data in a way that mimics an experimental design. Furthermore,
                    we will cover basic tensor-based techniques for analyzing the highly heterogenous urban data
                    that originate from a variety of urban data sources. The focus will be on matrix and tensor
                    factorization techniques that can provide information for latent urban activity patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We will present these analytical methods through examples from the urban space (e.g.,
                    transportation, urban economy, public policy etc.). Throughout our tutorial we will also provide
                    pointers to the relevant methodological literature.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Target Audience:</strong> The target audience for this tutorial includes academic and industry
                    researchers as well as government agencies. The audience is expected to have basic
                    familiarity with research methods and statistics. While pointers to advanced materials will be
                    provided, advanced knowledge of statistics and linear algebra is not necessary to follow the
                    tutorial.

                    Dr. Konstantinos Pelechrinis is interested in all aspects of the information cycle
                    (collection, transfer and analysis) and his ultimate goal is to deliver information-centric solutions
                    for the social good. He is an assistant professor at the School of Information Sciences at the
                    University of Pittsburgh, where he is mainly focused on the analysis of social network/media
                    data with an application on urban informatics. He is involved in understanding the social, spatial,
                    temporal and network dynamics of the behavior of people, developing models and algorithms
                    for intelligent urban services as well as studying the effect of location-based social media on
                    local businesses. In the past, he has been involved in research in computer networking and, in
                    particular, wireless and mobile networks - protocol design, real world experimentation, and
                    performance analysis for wireless network systems. He is extremely interested in the design and
                    implementation of practical systems, based on analytical frameworks. Konstantinos received his
                    PhD from the Computer Science department of University of California, Riverside, in 2010.
                    Previously he obtained his MSc degree from the Computer Science department of University of
                    California, Riverside in 2008 and the diploma of Electrical and Computer Engineering from the
                    National Technical University of Athens, Greece, in 2006. He has also held research intern
                    positions at LANL, Thomson Research Labs Paris and MSR Cambridge. He was a visiting
                    researcher at the University of Thessaly during Fall 2008. He is a recepient of the Army
                    Research Office Young Investigator (2015) for his work on composite networks.

                    Postdoctoral Associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he worked on social
                    networks in a city context, and his PhD thesis at UC London was nominated for BCS Best
                    British PhD dissertation in Computer Science. During his PhD, he was a Microsoft Research
                    PhD Scholar and MBA Technology Fellow of London Business School, and he also interned at
                    the National Research Council in Barcelona and at National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo. He
                    studied at Politecnico di Torino (Italy), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany), and
                    University of Illinois (USA).
